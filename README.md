# Visualizing Adversarial Input in CNN



## Open Source Code
[Pytorch CNN Visualization Library](https://github.com/utkuozbulak/pytorch-cnn-visualizations) - This is the base library we extended to visualize adversarial inputs. We used roughly 1k lines of this code written in Python, which mainly using the PyTorch library.

## Datasets
[ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org/)

## File Descriptions
The `src` directory contains all the source and executable code for this project. `GradientSaliency.ipynb`, `LayerwiseRelevance.ipynb`, `LayerCAM.ipynb`, `ScoreCAM.ipynb`, and `SmoothGrad.ipynb` are the files which included the modified library code used to produce each respective visualization.
