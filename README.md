# Visualizing Adversarial Input in CNN



## Open Source Code
[Pytorch CNN Visualization Library](https://github.com/utkuozbulak/pytorch-cnn-visualizations) - This is the base library we extended to visualize adversarial inputs. We used roughly 1k lines of this code written in Python, which mainly using the PyTorch library.
